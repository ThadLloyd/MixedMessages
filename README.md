## What to Expect

In this JavaScript file you will see that I have created two arrays which store different values in different indicies of the array.
I've then gone on to generate a random number with the **randomNumber** function,
After which I have created a generator for the message that I was prompted with.
I've done this by:

1. Setting *two* parameters for the function that take in different random numbers
2. Setting variables that utilize the first and second parameters to reference a specific index of the arrays above using the two random number parameters
3. Returning an output using the two variables that I have created with the arrays indicies that have been selected randomly.

Lastly, I have logged to the console the calling of the *generateMessage()* function with two instances of the *randomNumber()* function for the parameters.
